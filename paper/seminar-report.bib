  abstract = {The co-existence of various kinds of devices, protocols, architectures, and applications make Internet of Things (IoT) systems complex to develop, even for experienced programmers. When novice programmers are learning to implement these systems, they are required to deal with areas in which they do not have a deep knowledge. Furthermore, besides becoming proficient in these areas separately, they should integrate them and build a system whose components are heterogeneous from both software and hardware perspectives. The accurate understanding of the most challenging issues that novices face is fundamental to envision strategies aimed at easing the development of IoT systems. This paper focuses on identifying such issues in terms of software development tasks that novice programmers encounter when working on IoT systems. To this end, a survey was conducted among 40 novice developers that worked in groups developing IoT systems during several years of a university course. Based on their own experiences, individually and as a group, the most challenging development tasks were identified and prioritized over a common architecture, in terms of difficulty level and efforts. In addition, qualitative data about the causes of these issues was collected and analyzed. Finally, the paper offers critical insights and points out possible future work.},

  abstract = {Summary             In the theory of real-time scheduling, tasks are described by mathematical variables, which are used in analytical models in order to prove schedulability of the system. On real-time Linux, tasks are computer programs, and Linux developers try to lower the latencies caused by the Linux kernel, trying to achieve faster response for the highest-priority task. Although both seek temporal correctness, they use different abstractions, which end up separating these efforts in two different worlds, making it hard for the Linux practitioners to understand and apply the formally proved models to the Linux kernel and for theoretical researchers to apply the restrictions imposed by Linux for the theoretical models. This paper traces a parallel between the theory of response-time analysis and the abstractions used in the Linux kernel. The contribution of this paper is threefold. We first identify the PREEMPT RT Linux kernel mechanisms that impact the timing of real-time tasks and map these impacts to the main abstractions used by the real-time scheduling theory. Then, we describe a customized trace tool, based on the existing trace infrastructure of the Linux kernel, that allows the measurement of the delays associated with the main abstractions of the real-time scheduling theory. Finally, we use this customized trace tool to characterize the timing lines resulting from the behavior of the PREEMPT RT Linux kernel. Copyright {\copyright} 2015\,John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, there has been a considerable interest in using Linux in real-time systems, especially for industrial control. The simple and elegant design of Linux guarantees reliability and very good performance, while its open-source license allows to modify and change the source code according to the user needs. However, Linux has been designed to be a general-purpose operating system. Therefore, it presents some issues like unpredictable latencies and limited support for real-time scheduling. In this paper, we present our experience in the design and implementation of the real-time scheduler that has been recently included in the Linux kernel. The scheduler is based on the Resource Reservation paradigm, which allows to enforce temporal isolation between the running tasks. We describe the genesis of the project, the challenges we have encountered, the implementation details and the API offered to the programmers. Then, we show the experimental results measured on a real hardware. Copyright {\copyright} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Due to the complexity of hardware and software on Linux-based platforms, it is challenging to meet the performance requirements, especially for the mixed-criticality system with both real-time and best-effort tasks. We propose a reference design of Linuxbased mixed-criticality system using PREEMPT RT patch to improve real-time performance and QEMU/KVM virtual machine to reduce interferences. An evaluation environment of the proposed design is built with recent software and hardware to investigate the performance characteristics via experimental measurements. We measure and analyze the baseline kernel latency, the system throughput and the real-time performance under multiple conditions. In detailed analysis, we reveal novel insights on the real-time capabilities and limitations of Linux-based embedded systems. The results show that our design can meet the 100 {\textmu}s deadline goal of 1 kHz real-time task with high probability under various extreme interferences, and can deliver high throughput for best-effort workload.},

  abstract = {The increasing functional and nonfunctional requirements of real-time applications, the advent of mixed criticality computing, and the necessity of reducing costs are leading to an increase in the interest for employing COTS hardware in real-time domains. In this scenario, the Linux kernel is emerging as a valuable solution on the software side, thanks to the rich support for hardware devices and peripherals, along with a well-established programming environment. However, Linux has been developed as a general-purpose operating system, followed by several approaches to introduce actual real-time capabilities in the kernel. Among these, the PREEMPT\_RT patch, developed by the kernel maintainers, has the goal to increase the predictability and reduce the latencies of the kernel directly modifying the existent kernel code. This article aims at providing a survey of the state-of-the-art approaches for building real-time Linux-based systems, with a focus on PREEMPT\_RT, its evolution, and the challenges that should be addressed in order to move PREEMPT\_RT one step ahead. Finally, we present some applications and use cases that have already benefited from the introduction of this patch.},
